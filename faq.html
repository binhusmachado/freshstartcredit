                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Yes, credit repair is completely legal. The <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong> gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information on their credit reports. Credit repair companies simply help you exercise these legal rights.</p>
                                <p>At Fresh Start Credit Solutions, we strictly comply with the <strong>Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA)</strong> and all state regulations. We provide all required disclosures and never make false promises.</p>

                                <p>The timeline varies depending on your specific situation, but here's what you can generally expect:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>First results:</strong> 30-45 days after disputes are submitted</li>
                                    <li><strong>Significant improvement:</strong> 3-6 months for most clients</li>
                                    <li><strong>Full results:</strong> 6-12 months for complex cases</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Credit bureaus have 30 days to investigate disputes (45 days in certain cases). Multiple rounds of disputes may be needed depending on the creditor's responses.</p>

                                <p>No ethical credit repair company can guarantee specific results because we don't control the credit bureaus or creditors. What we <strong>can</strong> guarantee:</p>

                                    <li>We will dispute all inaccurate, unverifiable, or unfair items on your reports</li>
                                    <li>We will use every legal tool available under the FCRA and FDCPA</li>
                                    <li>We will be transparent about our progress and honest about your prospects</li>
                                    <li>If we don't achieve any deletions in 90 days, you pay nothing (per-deletion pricing)</li>

                                <p>Score increases vary widely depending on your starting point and what gets removed. Some general guidelines:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Removing one major collection: 20-50 points</li>
                                    <li>Removing late payments: 10-30 points per item</li>
                                    <li>Multiple deletions: Can be 100+ points in some cases</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p><strong>Important:</strong> We focus on <strong>approval odds</strong>, not just scores. A mortgage lender cares about your full credit profile, not just a number.</p>

                                <p>Yes, this is one of our specialties. Different loan programs have different requirements:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>FHA loans:</strong> Minimum 580 credit score, more flexible with collections and disputes</li>
                                    <li><strong>Conventional loans:</strong> Typically need 620+, stricter requirements</li>
                                    <li><strong>VA loans:</strong> No minimum score, but lenders often want 620+</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>We tailor our strategy to your target loan program and timeline. If you're planning to buy in 6-12 months, we can create a plan to get you mortgage-ready.</p>

                            <h3>Should I pay off collections before applying for a loan?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p><strong>It depends.</strong> Paying off a collection doesn't automatically remove it from your credit report — the negative mark stays, just with a "paid" status.</p>
                                
                                <p>For some loan programs (like FHA), you may need to pay off collections over a certain amount. For others, it doesn't matter.</p>
                                
                                <p>Our approach:</p>

                                    <li>First, try to remove the collection through dispute/validation</li>
                                    <li>If it can't be removed, negotiate a "pay for delete" if possible</li>
                                    <li>Only pay without deletion if your loan program requires it</li>
                                </ul>
